# MyCodilityAwnsers

This repository contains my solutions to various Codility programming challenges in C#.

Each puzzle is placed in its own folder and includes:

- A `Solution.cs` file with the core implementation
- A `README.md` that explains the problem, the algorithmic approach, code logic, and time complexity
- A short reflection on how I approached the problem and what I learned

The goal is to keep the code clean and consistent while clearly explaining the reasoning behind each solution.
